This page gives a summary of each of the known available OR1k-compliant implementations.

= Cores =

== OR1200 ==

This processor has its own page on this wiki with details, see [[OR1200 OpenRISC Processor]]

It's source code can be found in the [http://opencores.org/websvn,listing?repname=openrisc&path=%2Fopenrisc%2Ftrunk%2For1200%2F#path_openrisc_trunk_or1200_ OpenCores SVN]

== mor1kx ==

This core aims to implement a variety of pipelines offering the ability to trade area for speed. It also is intended to be a good platform for experimentation with pipeline implementations such as superscalar, out of order execution, threading and the like.

The current three pipelines, however, are relatively simple and being developed to provide a stable, up-to-date implementation going forward. It is intended for implementation on both FPGA and ASIC.

Implemented peripherals are tick timer, PIC unit, debug unit (single stepping and software breakpoints only), caches (some pipelines only) and Wishbone bus interface.

It is currently hosted here: http://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx

It is licensed under a weak copy-left (source file level) license created specifically for it, the Open Hardware Description License (OHDL). For details see http://juliusbaxter.net/ohdl

== AltOr32 ==

AltOR32 is an OpenRISC 1000 architecture derived RISC CPU targeted at small FPGAs and contains only the most basic ISA features from the OpenRisc project. 

Instructions & registers relating to Vector, floating-point, 64-bit extensions, MMU & Cache have been omitted.

The aim of AltOR32 is to provide a simple 32-bit soft CPU architecture aimed at control applications that can fit in low-end FPGA technology. 

This architecture re-uses the OpenRisc GNU toolchain hence implements all instructions that cannot be disabled. Anything else is viewed as beyond the scope of this cut-down soft-CPU implementation.

It is hosted here on OpenCores: http://opencores.org/project,altor32

== OR10 ==

This core implements the complete OpenRISC ORBIS32 instruction set. It has a very simple design, one could say suboptimal, or even naive. It does not implement the jump delay slot. It has a single Wishbone bus for both instruction fetches and data access.

It is flagged as no longer maintained.

See https://github.com/rdiez/orbuild/tree/master/Scripts/Projects/OpenRISC/OR10/CPU for more.

== or1knd i5 ==
The ''or1knd i5'' is written in VHDL and is part of the [https://github.com/pgavin/carpe ''CARPE''] research project by Peter Gavin. It is a 5-stage pipeline, delay-slot-free implementation.

= Simulation models =

== or1ksim ==

[[Or1ksim]] is the golden reference instruction set simulator (ISS) for OpenRISC 1000, providing instruction level simulation of the processor and common peripherals. It also provides extensive trace and debug facilities.

== jor1k ==

[http://s-macke.github.com/jor1k/ jor1k] is an OpenRISC 1000 emulator written in Javascript. Developed by Sebastian Macke and Gerard Braad. Find documentation [https://github.com/s-macke/jor1k/wiki here].

= CPU ID Table =

This table identifies CPU implementations (and models) as per the 8-bit CPUID field in the VR2 introduced in OR1K architecture version 1.0.
