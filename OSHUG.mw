= OSHUG 17 =

This page is for those attending the [http://oshug.org/event/17 OSHUG Event 17 in London March 29, 2012].

== Event Information ==

The event, titled '''Practical System-on-Chip (Program your own open source FPGA SoC)''' will cover the OpenRISC project and its system-on-chip platform, ORPSoC. It will be presented by Dr Jeremy Bennett, Chief Executive of [http://www.embecosm.com Embecosm], and Julius Baxter.

More information can be found at the OSHUG website [http://oshug.org/event/17 here].

You must [http://oshugfpgasoc.eventbrite.com/ register to attend].

The event will begin at 18:00.

== Programme ==

The evening will consist of:

* Introductions to SoC and processor technology
* Overview of OpenCores and the OpenRISC Project
* Presentation and demonstration of ORPSoC and the OpenRISC platform
* Details on how to build your own SoC (port ORPSoC to your own board)

It will hopefully be quite a practical session. However, to achieve this it is recommended that the set up drudgery be done ''prior'' to the event.

== Recommended pre-installation ==

* A checkout of the OpenCores OpenRISC subversion (SVN) repository
 cd ~/somwhere/appropriate/
 svn checkout http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk openrisc

* Build and install or1ksim as per [[Or1ksim#Installation|this page]]
* Build and install the GNU tool chain as per [[OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain#Building|this page]]
* Install [http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/ gtkwave] - hopefully it's available via your distro's package manager
* Install the [http://iverilog.icarus.com/ Icarus Verilog] simulator - hopefully it's available under your  distro's package manager (it's iverilog on Ubuntu)

It's unlikely we'll get onto actually running FPGA synthesis and instead we'll focus on demonstrating the tool chain and simulating the SoC  with open source EDA tools.

== Slides/Downloads ==
