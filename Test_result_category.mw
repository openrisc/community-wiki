The DejaGNU testing can yield the following results, which are consistent with POSIX 1003.3.

* '''PASS'''. The test passed as expected.
* '''FAIL'''. The test failed
* '''XPASS'''. A test that was expected to fail in fact passed.
* '''XFAIL'''. A test failed as expected
* '''UNRESOLVED'''. A test gave indeterminate results. For example due to a timeout
* '''UNTESTED'''. A place holder, where a test has yet to be written
* '''UNSUPPORTED'''. The system does not have the necessary functionality for this test. For example the test requires a Linux interface, but is being run on a bare metal target.

Note that '''XPASS''' and '''XFAIL''' are extensions to POSIX 1003.3 for clarity and convenience.
