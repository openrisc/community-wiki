This page contains the discussions from the "Open source processes for OpenRISC" session at the OpenRISC Project Meeting 2012.

__TOC__

=== Processes for review/maintainers ===
*   How we work within the project/organising the project?
**  Do we need a project manager?
*** Defining the role: Managing groups of people (i.e. 4 people working on something, perhaps joining forces) keeping organisational structure up to date on the wiki
*** Olof: taking charge of defining the role
*** Perhaps domain specific managers and someone managing they keep talking?
**  Process of review
*** Taking or1ksim structure and process, is this suitable for other parts?
*** At the very least should be documented.
**  Too many patches just left in the mailing list, system we have doesn't work.
*** Is silence (non-object) a sign of approval?
*** Github pull requests a method?
*** Patchwork - used by uboot
**** Test setup Monday
*** Separate mailing list for patches?
**** No (consensus)
** Need testing setup for RTL patches
*** Need to be conservative, can't just accept any patches.
*** Need release for OR1200 v3

=== Structure of the project ===

* Need to split up project?
** Page on opencores is the architecture, need sub-projects but where?
** Consensus: OR1K project - just architecture, contain list to subprojects. (A good entry page)
*** Entry point needs to be maintained. Needs to be definitive list to everything.
*** Need to sort out details on exactly how this should be done.

=== Choice of version control system and where do they live? ===

* We have users of SVN, git, upstream tools that use CVS, SVN and git.
* Opencores only generally have SVN supported
* What version control system should we use/global definition?
** Should it not matter as long as there is a link?
* Where should it live?
** From a developers standpoint does it matter, but what about for users?
** Keep stable/released versions on opencores

=== Mailing lists and IRC ===
* We have two different mailing lists
* Possible solution is to automate the cross-posting system previously agreed on. On opencores side this is ok, need to sort out openrisc side.
* IRC lists more logically separated.
