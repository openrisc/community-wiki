1. Register at [http://www.actel.com www.actel.com] to download software. Also register for a (free) license which should arrive by email after some time (30-60 minutes).

2. Download basic software package (currently version 9.1), [http://www.actel.com/products/software/libero/licensing.aspx#daemons license server daemons] and service pack (currently SP3).

3. To install basic software run:
  > chmod +rw LiberoLU91_Lin.bin.gz
  > gunzip LiberoLU91_Lin.bin.gz
  > chmod +x LiberoLU91_Lin.bin
  > sudo ./LiberoLU91_Lin.bin

4. To install server daemons run:
  > mkdir <path to actel>/license
  > cd <path to actel>/license
  > cp <download path>/Linux_licensing_Daemons.zip .
  > unzip Linux_licensing_Daemons.zip

5. Put the requested License.dat file from the email or Actel's site in <path to actel>/license. Open the file for editing and make sure the first lines read (with your specifics):
  SERVER <hostname> <ethernet mac adress> <port e.g. 1702>
  DAEMON actlmgrd <path to actel>/Libero/Libero/bin/actlmgrd
  VENDOR snpslmd  <path to actel>/Libero_v9.0/Synplify/linux/snpslmd

6. To install service pack 3 run:
  > cp libero91SP3_lin.tar $ALSDIR/Libero
  (Copy file to same level as /adm, /bin, /data, etc.)
  > tar xvf libero91SP3_lin.tar
  > sudo ./wsupdate.sh

7. Add the following to ~/.bashrc, updated with your specifics, to more easily start the license server. You can now start the license server with the alias "actel_lic", but make sure to read the notes below to get it working.
<pre>export ACTEL_LIC_FILE=<path to license file>
export ACTEL_LMGRD_LOG_FILE=<path to log file>
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<hostname>
export SYNPLCTYD_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<hostname>
export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<hostname>

# Paths for alias commands
export ALSDIR=<path to actel/Libero>
export ACTELSYNPLFYDIR=<path to actel/Libero/Synplify>
export PATH=$PATH:$ACTELSYNPLFYDIR/bin:$ACTELSYNPLFYDIR/linux:$ALSDIR/Libero/bin:$ALSDIR/Libero/lib/

# Actel license server launch alias
alias actel_lic='sudo $ALSDIR/Libero/bin/lmgrd -c $ACTEL_LIC_FILE -l $ACTEL_LMGRD_LOG_FILE; echo; \
echo "$ALSDIR/Libero/bin/lmgrd -c $ACTEL_LIC_FILE -l $ACTEL_LMGRD_LOG_FILE";echo; \
echo "do a \"tail -f /opt/actel/license/lmgrd.log\" to watch server launch"; echo'
</pre>
=== Notes for 64-bit Lubuntu 11.04 ===
May also be relevant for 32-bit systems, but some steps may not be needed.

* Install lsb (Linux Standard Base 4.0 support package) in Synaptic or through apt-get.
* acttclsh (Actel Tcl shell) requires Korn shell; install ksh
* If you get messages on not finding Libero X libraries, add the following to LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ~/.bashrc:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ALSLIB/Libero/lib/:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/X11:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* You need to install libmotif3, not libmotif4 available from the repositories, and it has to be a 32-bit version. Copy the following [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21462179 script from IBM] and run to install 32-bit Motif 3 libraries:
<pre>#!/bin/sh

if [ "`uname -m`" != "x86_64" ] ; then
        echo "This is only needed for 64 bits systems."
        exit -1
fi

echo Installing 32 bits libraries...

# compatibility libraries
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
TMP_DIR=/tmp/install_libmotif3_32_bits.$$
MOTIF3LIB=libmotif3_2.2.3-2_i386.deb
REPO=http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu

# compatibility libraries
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
mkdir ${TMP_DIR}

# Install the 32 bits version - because there is no 32 bits
# compatibility package, we need to use the library from the native
# 32 bits package.
# Note: The 32 bits lib will not be updated/upgraded automatically.
cd ${TMP_DIR} && wget ${REPO}/pool/multiverse/o/openmotif/${MOTIF3LIB}
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
        echo "Error downloading ${MOTIF3LIB}"
        exit -2
fi

dpkg-deb -x ${MOTIF3LIB} ${TMP_DIR}
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
        echo "Error extracting libraries from package"
        exit -3
fi

ls ${TMP_DIR}/usr/lib/lib*.so*

sudo mv -i ${TMP_DIR}/usr/lib/lib*.so* /usr/lib32

if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
        echo "32 bits motif installed"
        sudo ldconfig
else
        echo "Error moving libraries"
fi

echo "Removing temporary directory"
rm ${TMP_DIR} -fr
</pre>
* Make sure you have portmap installed, as it is needed by Wind/U.

= Simulators / Compilers =

== Icarus Verilog ==

This is an open source event-driven Verilog simulator. It's home page is [http://iverilog.icarus.com/ http://iverilog.icarus.com/]

=== Installation under Ubuntu ===

Using apt-get:

 sudo apt-get install verilog

== Silos ==

This is a relatively low-cost Verilog simulator. Its web page is [http://www.silvaco.com/products/verilogSimulation/silos.html http://www.silvaco.com/products/verilogSimulation/silos.html]

== Verilator ==

This is an open source tool that can be used to generate cycle-accurate C models from synthesizeable Verilog. It also has a quite thorough linting feature. Its web page is [http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator].

= Waveform Viewers =

= GTKWave =

This tool is a great open source waveform viewer. It's home page is [http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/ http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/].

== Installing under Ubuntu ==

The pre-packaged GTKWave can be installed under Ubuntu using apt-get with the following.

 sudo apt-get install gtkwave

== Building from source under Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit ==

Go grab the latest source bundle. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/]

Extract it.

 tar xzf gtkwave-3.3.26.tar.gz

Go in and configure it.

 cd gtkwave-3.3.26/
 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl

At this stage it complained I didn't have gperf installed

 sudo apt-get install gperf

At this stage it said xz couldn't be found for LZMA or VZT format support.
Ubuntu informs me I already have the xz-utils and lzma packages so I don't know what to install so just disable it.

 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl --disable-xz

At this point it complains I don't have gtk+-2.0 installed.

 sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0

Finally configure again.

 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl --disable-xz

Make and install it

 make
 sudo make install
