== Introduction ==

ORPSoC is the OpenRISC Reference Platform System-on-Chip. This project implements a platform for OpenRISC development. It provides a reference SoC, primarily for the testing and development of OpenRISC processors, and a set of pre-built SoCs for various FPGA boards.

The project's structure makes it simple to develop (and contribute) an OpenRISC-based design for implementation on hardware.

(This second version of ORPSoC was initially known as ORPSoCv2, however we intend on changing it back to be known simply as ORPSoC again)

[[ORPSoCv3]] is progressing well, and the developers would recommend people now use ORPSoCv3 instead.

== Download ORPSoC ==
The RTL source, test software and scripts can be downloaded from the OpenRISC project subversion (svn) repository. The sources can be checked out with the following command:

 <nowiki>svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/orpsocv2</nowiki>

=== Pre-built FPGA Images ===
Pre-built images for certain boards are available from the [[FPGA Development Boards|FPGA development boards]] pages.

== Documentation ==
The main set of documentation is now in texinfo format and included with the project source.

To generate a PDF of the documentation, change into the doc/ path of the project and run the following:

 ./configure
 make pdf

The texinfo and TeX processing tools are required to generate the documentation in PDF.
See the [[#Documentation_Utilities |section below]] for installation information.

== Supported Boards ==
There are board-specific builds of ORPSoC which should contain RTL and scripts enabling push-button synthesis and generation of programming files.

See the [[FPGA Development Boards|FPGA development boards]] page for information on supported boards.

If you succeed in porting ORPSoC to other hardware, we would greatly appreciate if the build were contributed for inclusion in ORPSoC.

== Installing required tools ==
There is a choice of three models to run the test software on. These are the architectural simulator, cycle-accurate and event-driven simulation models. Below are the instructions to install each of them. You need only install the tools for the model you wish to run. The GNU toolchain port is mandatory.


'''OpenRISC GNU toolchain port installation'''
Ensure the OpenRISC GNU toolchain port is installed on your system.

Please install the latest release candidate of the version 1.0 toolchain. Follow the guide on the [[OpenRISC GNU tool chain|GNU toolchain page]].


'''Architectural Simulator (or1ksim)'''
The tests included with ORPSoC's reference design can be run on the OpenRISC architectural simulator, or1ksim. See the [[or1ksim]] page for details on installation.

== Event-driven simulators ==
For the reference build of ORPSoC that is non-board targeted, Icarus Verilog is required. Board targets require Modelsim.

=== Icarus Verilog ===
[http://iverilog.icarus.com/ Icarus Verilog] is an open-source Verilog simulation tool. Their wiki has an extensive installation guide, but on most modern *nix distributions, such as Ubuntu or Debian, it can be easily installed by the system's package manager (apt, yum, emerge, etc.). The package is typically just called verilog. For instance, with apt under Ubuntu the installation command is:

 <nowiki>sudo apt-get install verilog</nowiki>

However, if it is not available via the package manager on on your platform please see the Icarus Verilog project's installation guide.

=== Cycle-accurate simulator ===
This simulator is a cycle accurate C++ model generated from the Verilog HDL by [http://www.veripool.org/ Verilator]. A System C wrapper is placed on the model so other System C modules can be used with it. The scripts require Verilator, its supporting tools, and the System C libaries, be installed to generate this model.
Cycle-accurate model generation with Verilator

The tool which generates the C++ model is Verilator. It is a free and open source tool, developed and maintained by Wilson Snyder et al. at Veripool.org. The generated C++ uses the SystemC simulation kernel and libraries. It is compiled with your system's C++ compiler to create a standalone simulation executable.


'''Installation of Verilator and supporting libraries'''

Following are the SystemC library installation instructions. Next is instructions on installing the two supporting Perl libraries used by Verilator; Verilog-Perl and System-Perl. Lastly, Verilator itself is installed. The following instructions are expanded upon those contained at Veripool's Verilator page.


'''Installing the SystemC library'''

The SystemC library can be obtained from the [http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc Accellera Systems Initiative ] (formerly Open SystemC Initiative, OSCI) website. The download page contains the link to download the core SystemC language and examples archive. Annoyingly, registration is required before downloading.

Once the package is downloaded and extracted, follow the provided README for full compilation and installation instructions.
A quick installation instruction list for most Linux platforms is provided below, starting in the systemc-x.x.x directory:

 mkdir objdir; cd objdir
 export CXX=g++
 ../configure
 # Note that this configures the current location as the permanent location of the systemc library
 make
 make install
 # Optionally....
 make check

Add export SYSTEMC=/path/to/systemc-x.x.x to ~/.bashrc


'''Installing Verilog-Perl'''

Download the latest release of Verilog-Perl by visiting its [http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Verilog::Language CPAN] site.

Currently the latest release (3.400) can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/W/WS/WSNYDER/Verilog-Perl-3.400.tar.gz here].
Extract it and follow the instructions in the include README file.

A quick installation instruction list for most Linux platforms is provided:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test (optional)
 sudo make install

'''Installing System-Perl'''

Download the latest release of Verilog-Perl by visiting its [http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Verilog::Language CPAN] site.

Currently the latest release (1.341) can be downloaded from [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/W/WS/WSNYDER/SystemPerl-1.341.tar.gz here].

Extract it and follow the instructions in the included README file. A quick installation instruction list for most Linux platforms is provided:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test (optional)
 sudo make install

Export the SYSTEMPERL environment variable in your shell startup script to point to the directory of this kit (the directory you ran <tt>make</tt> in). Eg for bash add something like <tt>export SYSTEMPERL=/path/to/SystemPerl-1.341</tt> to your ~/.bashrc file.


'''Installing Verilator'''

It is recommended Verilator is built and installed from source as follows:

 <nowiki>git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator</nowiki>
 cd verilator
 autoconf
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Add export <tt>VERILATOR_ROOT=/path/to/verilator_kit</tt> to ~/.bashrc (where /path/to/verilator_kit is the directory you typed <tt>make</tt> in).

The SystemC model toolchain should now be ready to compile ORPSoC.

== Usage Guides ==

The following are links to guides for performing various tasks with ORPSoC. Please feel free to add your own and extend what is already available.

[[ORPSoC_RTL_simulation_debugging | ORPSoC RTL simulation debugging]]

[[ORPSoC_Board_Software_Debugging | ORPSoC software debugging on the board]]

== Documentation Utilities ==

The following tools are required to compile the documentation source in the project's doc/ path, generating a PDF.

'''Texinfo'''

The documentation is provided in texinfo source format. To compile it, the texinfo tools are required.

Under Ubuntu, use the following command to install the required packages:

 sudo apt-get install texinfo

Under CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat use the following:

 sudo yum install texinfo texinfo-tex


'''TeX'''
[http://www.tug.org/begin.html TeX] is a typesetting system. To generate a PDF from the texinfo documentation, some TeX processing software is required.

Under Ubuntu, use the following command to install the required packages:

 sudo apt-get install texlive

Under CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat use the following:

 sudo yum install texlive texlive-latex 


'''Performing the tests'''

See the documentation in the project for running simulations of the system.
